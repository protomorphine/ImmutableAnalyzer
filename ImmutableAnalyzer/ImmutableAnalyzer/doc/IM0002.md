# IM0002 {#im0002}

The analyzer checks the accessor list of each property.

Diagnostic wouldn't report if:
- property has only a getter;
- property has a getter and private setter;
- property has a getter and `init` set accessor;

Diagnostic will report if:
- property has a public setter;

## Available code fixes   
This diagnostic support following fixes:
- `set;` => `private set;`
- `set;` => `init;`
