# Diagnostic IM0001 {#im0001}

Immutable type property must be immutable. See [immutable types](@ref immutable_types) for more information.

## Examples

<div class="tabbed">

- <b class="tab-title">Will report `IM0001`</b>
  Following code snippet will report `IM0001` diagnostic, because it allow changes of immutable class instance.
  ```csharp
  [Immutable]
  public class UserDto
  {
    // ...
    public List<long> FriendsIds { get; private set; } // IM0001
  }
  ```

  `UserDto` class is mutable, because everyone, who have instance of `UserDto` can change it state through `FriendsIds` property.
  ```csharp
  UserDto userDto = _repo.GetUser(...);
  userDto.FriendsIds.Add(42);
  ```
- <b class="tab-title">Wouldn't report `IM0001`</b>
  Correct code example, which doesn't affect class immutability, present below.
  ```csharp
  [Immutable]
  public class UserDto
  {
    // ...
    public IReadOnlyList<long> FriendsIds { get; private set; } = new List<long>();
  }
  ```

  Property with type `IReadOnlyList<long>` doesn't allow to modify list and can be used only for reading.
